IPC/Editor version 0.01
=======================

This module provides a simple API to calling an external text editor
from within your perl program.

This is a trivial task, but there are potential security issues
if you don't get it right, and it's fundamentally tedious to write
any piece of code more than once.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

During the testing process Proc::InvokeEditor will attempt to start
a text editor for testing. Please save the files opened immediately
with no changes.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  <some other modules, probably File::Temp>
